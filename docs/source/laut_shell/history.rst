Shell history
=============

LAUT stores the history of commands invoked permanently across multiple sessions
in the file '~/.laut_history.dat'. The advantage of this is that users can
perform <Up> & <Down> to navigate the history as well as perform reverse-i-search
akin to one in bash.

Advanced history
----------------

LAUT stores history as 5 parts with each being independent of the others:

1. Command history
2. *include*, *exclude*, *save* entry history
3. ``api`` argument history
4. LAUT-exec mode history
5. LAUT-cfg mode history

This was done to provide a separation between the different areas.

An example of reverse-i-search prompt appearing in *include* entry:

.. code-block:: console

   (l”ìut-host1) show ip route -i

   (reverse-i-search)`':

.. note::

   For mac users, please try to remap <CAPS_LOCK> key to <ctrl-r> using karabiner-elements.
   This way its much easier to always try reverse-i-search when typing something.
   To configure the remap, add a complex modification to karabiner-elements using the below JSON:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
       "description": "New Rule (change caps_lock to control-R)",
       "manipulators": [
           {
               "from": {
                   "key_code": "caps_lock"
               },
               "to": {
                   "key_code": "r",
                   "modifiers": [
                       "control"
                   ]
               },
               "type": "basic"
           }
       ]
      }
