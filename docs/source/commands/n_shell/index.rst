N shell commands
================

They are equivalent to LAUT operator commands but do not autogenerate
corresponding blitz action snippets.

.. list-table:: N shell command to its functionally equivalent LAUT operator command mapping
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - N shell command
     - Operator command
   * - n_execute
     - execute
   * - n_configure
     - configure
   * - n_parse
     - parse
   * - n_api
     - api
   * - n_run_genie_sdk
     - run_genie_sdk

These command names just prepend a ``n_`` in front of its corresponding functionally
equivalent LAUT operator command name with the only difference being that there is no
autogeneration of corresponding blitz action code snippet for the 'N' commands. Hence
they are primarily used for debugging in the midst of an LAUT session which does not
mess with the generated blitz action outputs.

A simple example of ``n_execute`` which shows its equivalence to the ``execute`` command
but with the INCLUDE,EXCLUDE,SAVE section prompts missing as well as no blitz
action snippet autogenerated observed by ``list 1`` command:
