save
====

Saves autogenerated blitz snippets together into a blitz testcase file.

``save`` takes all the autogenerated blitz action snippets so far and writes them together into a blitz
testcase YAML file. The path to the testcase YAML file needs to be provided as an argument to the
``save`` command. The name of the blitz trigger would be the same as the testcase file name.

An example for ``save`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   (lӓut-l2switch) save pyats/testcases/TC1.yaml
   LAUT-INFO: File 'pyats/testcases/TC1.yaml' saved successfully
   (lӓut-l2switch)

Contents of file 'pyats/testcases/TC1.yaml' would contain a blitz trigger named 'TC1'
containing all the blitz action snippets autogenerated so far:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # TC1.yaml
   # LAUT Generated testcase
   TC1:
       source:
           pkg: genie.libs.sdk
           class: triggers.blitz.blitz.Blitz
       devices: ['l2switch']
       test_sections:
           - default:
               - configure:
                   device: l2switch
                   command: ['no logging console']
               - configure:
                   device: l2switch
                   command: |
                       interface Loopback30
                       ip address 100.100.100.100 255.255.255.255
               - execute:
                   device: l2switch
                   command: ['show ip route']
                   include:
                       - 'C\\s+100.100.100.100 is directly connected, Loopback30'
