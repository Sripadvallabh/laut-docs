save
====

Saves autogenerated blitz snippets together into a blitz testcase file.

Basic usage
-----------

``save`` takes all the blitz test section with their autogenerated action snippets and writes
them together into a blitz testcase YAML file. The path to the testcase YAML file needs to be
provided as an argument to the ``save`` command. The name of the blitz trigger would be the same as the testcase file name.

An example for ``save`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   (lӓut-host1) list -a
   default:
     - configure:
         device: host1
         command: no logging console
     - sleep:
         sleep_time: 2
     - execute:
         device: host1
         command: show ip route
         include:
           - 1.1.1.1
   new:
     - configure:
         device: host1
         command: no ip domain lookup
   (lӓut-host1)
   (lӓut-host1) save pyats/testcases/TC1.yaml

   2024-07-29 19:16:09: %LAUT-INFO: :              File 'pyats/testcases/TC1.yaml' saved successfully              :
   2024-07-29 19:16:09: %LAUT-INFO: +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   (lӓut-host1)

Contents of file 'pyats/testcases/TC1.yaml' would contain a blitz trigger named 'TC1'
containing both 'default' and 'new' test sections:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # TC1.yaml
   # 29 July 2024
   # LAUT Generated testcase
   TC1:
     source:
       pkg: genie.libs.sdk
       class: triggers.blitz.blitz.Blitz
     devices:
       - host1
     test_sections:
       - default:
           - configure:
               device: host1
               command: no logging console
           - sleep:
               sleep_time: 2
           - execute:
               device: host1
               command: show ip route
               include:
                 - 1.1.1.1
       - new:
           - configure:
               device: host1
               command: no ip domain lookup
