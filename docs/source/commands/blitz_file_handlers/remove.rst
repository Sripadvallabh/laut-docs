remove
======

Deletes autogenerated blitz action snippets.

Basic usage
-----------

There are 3 ways of using the ``remove`` command much alike the ``list`` command:

   * ``remove <NUMBER>``: Removes last 'n' autogenerated snippets.
   * ``remove -n <SECTION_NAME>``: Removes given test section.
   * ``remove -a``: Removes all test sections and their autogenerated snippets.

``remove <NUMBER>``
-------------------

The command ``remove 1`` deletes the last autogenerated blitz action snippet.

A simple example showing the removal of the last ``sleep`` blitz action snippet:

.. code-block::

   (lӓut-host1) list 2
   configure:
     device: host1
     command: no logging console
   sleep:
     sleep_time: 5
   (lӓut-host1)
   (lӓut-host1) remove 1
   (lӓut-host1)
   (lӓut-host1) list 2
   configure:
     device: host1
     command: no logging console
   (lӓut-host1)

In the above example, after ``remove 1`` we notice the last autogenerated *'sleep'* blitz
action snippet being removed from ``list 2`` output.

It is important to note that ``remove <NUMBER>`` does not delete autogenerated blitz action snippets
beyond the current test section.
For example, if we create a test section called 'new' and try to remove the last autogenerated blitz
action snippet, we observe the following:

.. code-block:: console

   (lӓut-host1) list 3
   configure:
     device: host1
     command: no logging console
   sleep:
     sleep_time: 2
   execute:
     device: host1
     command: show ip route
     include:
       - 1.1.1.1
   (lӓut-host1)
   (lӓut-host1) test_section new
   (lӓut-host1)
   (lӓut-host1) remove 1
   (lӓut-host1)
   (lӓut-host1) list -n default
   default:
     - configure:
         device: host1
         command: no logging console
     - sleep:
         sleep_time: 2
     - execute:
         device: host1
         command: show ip route
         include:
           - 1.1.1.1
   (lӓut-host1)

As seen above, once a new test section is created, ``remove <NUMBER>`` can no longer be used to delete
the autogenerated blitz action snippets of the earlier test section.

``remove -n <SECTION_NAME>``
----------------------------

This form of the ``remove`` command is used to delete a particular test section and all autogenerated blitz
action snippets under it.

Continuing with the above example wherein we couldn't delete the 3 autogenerated snippets of the earlier
section after creating a new test section 'new', we could delete them by invoking ``remove -n default``
('default' was the earlier test section):

.. code-block:: console

   (lӓut-host1) remove -n default
   (lӓut-host1) list -n default
   (lӓut-host1)

As seen above, ``remove -n`` deleted the entire test section; hence please use with caution.

``remove -a``
--------------

To delete everything autogenerated so far(all test sections and their actions), one can use ``remove -a``.

See an example below:

.. code-block:: console

   (lӓut-host1) list -a
   default:
     - configure:
         device: host1
         command: no logging console
     - sleep:
         sleep_time: 2
     - execute:
         device: host1
         command: show ip route
         include:
           - 1.1.1.1
   new:
     - configure:
         device: host1
         command: no ip domain lookup
   (lӓut-host1) remove -a
   (lӓut-host1) list -a
   (lӓut-host1)

Both the test sections 'default' and 'new' were deleted with their corresponding action snippets in
one shot using this command. Because of this, ``list -a`` now prints nothing.
